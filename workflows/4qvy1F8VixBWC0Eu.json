Your goal is to retain the original message while improving clarity, engagement, and visual storytelling.\n\n## Context  \n- You will receive:\n  - The original video title  \n  - A natural language description of the thumbnail image  \n  - The full video transcript  \n- Your output should be a single JSON object that includes:\n  - A revised, SEO-optimized video title  \n  - Concise thumbnail text (3–5 words) that complements the revised title and aligns with the thumbnail’s visual tone.\n\n## Instructions  \n1. Read and analyze the original video title for its main topic and keywords.  \n2. Use the thumbnail description and video transcript to better understand the visual and content themes.  \n3. Generate a new title that:\n   - Maintains the original intent and main keywords  \n   - Improves structure, clarity, or emotional appeal  \n   - Stays under 70 characters  \n4. Create 3–5 words of thumbnail text that:\n   - Adds insight, urgency, or intrigue to support the title  \n   - Aligns with the visual style of the thumbnail  \n   - Feels natural when paired with the title  \n\n5. Output a single JSON object with both the revised title and thumbnail text in the following format:  \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"newTitle\": \"Improved YouTube video title\",\n     \"thumbnailText\": \"3–5 word thumbnail text\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Tools  \n- Original Title: `{{ $('Step 1 Results').item.json.title }}`  \n- Thumbnail Description: `{{ $('Analyze Thumbnail').item.json.choices[0].message.content }}`  \n- Video Transcript: `{{ $('HTTP Request').item.json.captions }}`  \n\n## Examples  \n**Input:**  \n- Title: `\"He Built an AI Business With Just $100\"`  \n- Thumbnail Description: `\"A thumbnail showing a confident man pointing at a laptop, with large text reading 'From $100 to CEO'. The background features glowing tech icons on a dark gradient backdrop.\"`  \n- Transcript: *Describes how the subject bootstrapped a business using AI tools and minimal funding.*\n\n**Output:**  \n```json\n{\n  \"newTitle\": \"How He Launched an AI Startup with $100\",\n  \"thumbnailText\": \"AI Startup for $100\"\n}\n```\n\n**Input:**  \n- Title: `\"Top 10 ChatGPT Hacks You Didn't Know\"`  \n- Thumbnail Description: `\"A sleek modern thumbnail with neon text that says 'ChatGPT Tricks', showing a split screen of a person thinking and a glowing terminal interface.\"`  \n- Transcript: *Lists lesser-known prompts and features to boost productivity.*\n\n**Output:**  \n```json\n{\n  \"newTitle\": \"10 ChatGPT Hacks to Boost Productivity\",\n  \"thumbnailText\": \"Hidden GPT Features\"\n}\n```\n\n## SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)  \n1. Parse the input values: original title, thumbnail description, and transcript.  \n2. Identify key themes and keywords from the title.  \n3. Use visual and transcript context to improve the relevance and appeal of the new title.  \n4. Draft 1–2 thumbnail text options based on visual cues and the revised title.  \n5. Select the most compelling option.  \n6. Return the output as a clean JSON object with both fields.\n\n## Final Notes  \n- Do not include brand names or identifiable individuals unless they are generic and essential.  \n- Avoid vague adjectives and hype-driven phrasing.  \n- Keep the output concise, natural, and clear — ready for immediate use in automation or upload.\n---","role":"system"}]},"simplify":false,"jsonOutput":true,"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi","typeVersion":1.8,"position":[-220,340],"id":"afaf9552-de0b-4c5b-9fa6-56abcb96fff5","name":"YouTube Title Generator","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"wD7TRQWBCWoxmac0","name":"OpenAi account"}}},{"parameters":{"resource":"image","operation":"analyze","modelId":{"__rl":true,"value":"gpt-4o-mini","mode":"list","cachedResultName":"GPT-4O-MINI"},"text":"=# Overview  \nYou are an AI agent responsible for analyzing a YouTube thumbnail via a provided URL and generating a single, well-written **natural language description** that captures the visual style, layout, and tone of the thumbnail. This description will be used as part of an image generation prompt to recreate a similarly styled thumbnail.\n\n## Context  \n- The agent uses OpenAI’s image understanding capabilities to visually analyze YouTube thumbnails.  \n- The goal is to create a **descriptive text output** that reflects the design, mood, and layout of the thumbnail — not to copy the content directly.  \n- The output should be a standalone sentence or paragraph in natural language, ready to be embedded in a larger prompt.\n\n## Instructions  \n1. Retrieve and analyze the thumbnail image from the given YouTube URL.  \n2. Identify and describe the following elements:\n   - Overall layout and composition  \n   - Character or subject placement (if applicable)  \n   - Background type and visual treatment  \n   - Font and text style, including content if legible  \n   - Dominant color palette and mood  \n3. Compose a fluent, single-string natural language description of the thumbnail.  \n4. The output should read like part of a prompt, e.g., \"An energetic YouTube thumbnail showing...\"  \n5. Do not include any structured formatting (like JSON, lists, or metadata).  \n\n## Tools  \n- OpenAI Image Understanding Node  \n\n## Examples  \n- **Input:**  \n  `https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HpkZU34fqUM/maxresdefault.jpg`  \n- **Output:**  \n  A high-energy YouTube thumbnail featuring a surprised man on the right side, with a bold red radial gradient background.

Soft blue and gray tones dominate the scene, with sleek sans-serif text centered above the device.\n\n## SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)  \n1. Validate the provided YouTube thumbnail URL.  \n2. Retrieve the image and perform visual analysis using image capabilities.  \n3. Extract and synthesize details about layout, colors, subjects, and visual emphasis.  \n4. Write a **natural language description** that feels prompt-ready, descriptive, and cohesive.  \n5. Return only the final descriptive sentence or paragraph — no metadata, formatting, or JSON.\n\n## Final Notes  \n- Do not refer to brand names, creators, or exact text unless it's generic and descriptive.  \n- Focus on tone, layout, and composition to support style transfer, not replication.  \n- The description should serve as a high-quality visual summary usable in generative

I talk about the phenomenological, existentialist and humanistic psychology angle on self-improvement (growth vs change) and what's the actual psychology behind self-improvement?\n\n0:00 Why do we want improvement?\n1:21 Self-consciousness\n2:08 The fundamental psychological problem\n2:55 What is the human psyche?\n4:08 The problem with self-improvement\n5:02 What to do instead then?\n5:52 Is there anything good about self-improvement?\n\nTo contrast the self-help movement (Atomic habits and other self-help books, people like Andrew Huberman, Matt D’Avella, Nathaniel Drew, Hamza, or lifestyles like minimalism, etc) I implicitly argue viewpoints from thinkers like Carl Rogers, Martin Heidegger, Carl Jung, Rollo May or Irvin Yalom:)\n\nBtw, this is not a rejection of growth but a critique of the relentless, hyper‑individualistic obsession with becoming a “better version” of yourself. Instead, I argue for something deeper: growth that comes from self-understanding, reconciliation with our past, and a realistic engagement with our context. This isn’t about giving up on the idea of becoming better, it’s about questioning what “better” really means, and whether the methods we’re sold actually help us get there. If you’ve ever felt like improvement left you emptier than before, you’re not alone. Maybe the answer isn’t to fix yourself, but to relate differently to yourself, to others, and to the world.\n\n#habitsthatchangeyourlife #phenomenology

By embracing principles like self-discipline, mindfulness, and resilience, you’ll learn to silence fear and stand firm in your decisions. Stoicism teaches that true confidence comes from within—focusing on what you control and letting go of external validation. Through powerful insights and practical exercises, you’ll discover how to build mental strength, face challenges with calm determination, and radiate a presence so assured that doubt has no room to exist. Transform your mindset and step into unwavering self-belief with the wisdom of the Stoics. \n\nDon't Forget to Subscribe: ‪@Samurai.Insights‬ \n--------------------------------------\n⚠️FAIR USE DISCLAIMER\n\nAll multimedia content in this video is used for purpose of review & commentary under terms of fair use.

It involves consciously seeking to enhance one’s skills, knowledge, attributes, and overall well-being. Here is a detailed look at the concept of self-improvement:\n1. Definition\nSelf-improvement refers to the deliberate effort to improve one’s own character, skills, habits, and overall life experience. It is a pursuit that can take many forms, including physical, emotional, intellectual, and social enhancement.\n2. Areas of Self-Improvement\n• Physical Health: This includes maintaining a healthy diet, regular exercise, proper sleep, and personal hygiene. Better physical health often leads to increased energy and improved mood.\n• Mental Health: Involves understanding and improving emotional well-being, managing stress, and seeking help for mental health issues. Techniques often include mindfulness, meditation, therapy, and stress management strategies.\n• Intellectual Growth: This encompasses acquiring new knowledge or skills, pursuing education (formal or informal), and engaging in activities that stimulate the mind—such as reading, taking courses, or attending workshops.\n• Career Development: Setting career goals, improving professional skills, seeking promotions, or transitioning into new fields or roles. This can include networking, enhancing resumes, and continuous learning.\n• Interpersonal Skills: Enhancing communication, relationship-building, and conflict resolution skills. This often aims to improve personal and professional relations.\n• Financial Literacy: Learning to manage finances effectively, including budgeting, saving, investing, and understanding credit.\n• Spiritual Growth: Exploring personal beliefs, values, and spirituality. This might involve activities like meditation, prayer, or philosophical study.\n3. Techniques and Tools for Self-Improvement\n• Goal Setting: Establishing clear, achievable, and measurable goals. The SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) are commonly used for effective goal setting.\n• Reflective Journaling: Keeping a journal to reflect on thoughts, feelings, and experiences can help identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for growth.\n• Time Management: Prioritizing tasks and managing time efficiently to reduce stress and increase productivity.\n• Feedback: Seeking constructive criticism from peers, mentors, or supervisors can provide valuable insights for improvement.\n• Mindfulness and Meditation: Practices that promote awareness and help in managing stress and emotions.\n• Reading and Continuous Learning: Engaging with books, courses, podcasts, or other educational resources to gain new perspectives and skills.\n• Accountability Partners: Working with a friend or mentor who can help keep you accountable for your goals.\n4. Challenges in Self-Improvement\n• Lack of Motivation: Maintaining the drive to continue improving can be difficult, especially when faced with setbacks.\n• Time Constraints: Finding time to dedicate to self-improvement can be challenging, especially in a busy world.\n• Fear of Failure: The fear of not achieving goals can deter people from pursuing improvement.\n• Overwhelm: The vastness of areas to improve can lead to feeling overwhelmed and unsure of where to start.\n5. The Importance of Self-Improvement\n• Enhanced Quality of Life: Engaging in self-improvement can lead to greater satisfaction and fulfillment in life.\n• Increased Resilience: Developing skills to cope with adversity and challenges can lead to improved mental and emotional strength.\n• Personal Empowerment: Taking control of one’s growth fosters a sense of agency, self-esteem, and confidence.\n• Better Relationships: Improved interpersonal skills can lead to healthier and more fulfilling relationships with others.\n6. Practical Steps to Start the Journey\n• Identify Focus Areas: Reflect on what aspects of life you’d like to improve; prioritize them based on importance.\n• Set Realistic Goals: Break down goals into smaller, manageable tasks.\n• Create an Action Plan: Outline steps to achieve your goals and set timelines.\n• Monitor Progress: Regularly check in on your goals and adjust your plans as necessary.\n• Celebrate Small Wins: Recognizing and celebrating progress, no matter how minor, reinforces motivation.\nIn essence, self-improvement is a lifelong journey that requires commitment, introspection, and a willingness to evolve. Each person’s path may differ, but the underlying pursuit is about becoming a better version of oneself.","subtitles":null,"order":10,"commentsTurnedOff":false,"fromYTUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=self+improvement&sp=CAISBggEEAEYAw%3D%3D","isMonetized":null,"hashtags":[],"formats":[],"isMembersOnly":false,"input":"self improvement"}},{"json":{"title":"What Does Your Character Represent? | Personal Development","type":"video","id":"wMO_mD6jSN8","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMO_mD6jSN8","thumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wMO_mD6jSN8/hqdefault.jpg","viewCount":165,"date":"2025-06-24T14:52:13.000Z","likes":80,"location":null,"channelName":"NeotericDissolution","channelUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/@NeotericDissolution","channelId":"UCKcnA6jgioxY9v2rvohQEuQ","channelUsername":"NeotericDissolution","numberOfSubscribers":2310,"duration":"00:10:28","commentsCount":0,"text":"Choose Self Development & Self Mastery 🧠\n\nUnlock your highest potential.

In this deep dive into Carl Jung’s shadow work, we expose the uncomfortable truth: your hidden pain, repressed rage, and denied desires are the very forces sabotaging your growth.\n\n📌 In this video, you’ll discover:\n✔ Why “positive thinking” can actually keep you stuck (the toxic illusion no one admits)\n✔ The psychological trap of spiritual bypassing—are you using growth to avoid yourself?\n✔ How your shadow secretly controls your relationships, decisions, and self-worth\n✔ The rebellion phase—how to integrate your darkness without becoming it\n✔ The ultimate truth about wholeness (hint: it’s not about being “good”)\n\nThis isn’t another fluffy self-help guide. This is a confrontation with the self you’ve been running from.\n\n💬 Your Turn: Have you ever noticed your shadow at work?

While society pushes you to hustle harder, level up, and constantly optimize every part of your life—Stoicism teaches a different path: one rooted in stillness, self-awareness, and inner peace.\n\nYou’ll discover why endless self-help routines can lead to burnout, how constant self-optimization creates hidden anxiety, and what the Stoics believed about true strength, discipline, and emotional control.\n\nThis isn’t just a critique of modern productivity—it’s a wake-up call for those who want to build real mental strength and live with clarity, presence, and purpose.\n\nWhether you're on a personal growth journey, struggling with burnout, or simply seeking deeper wisdom, this video will help you see through the noise and return to what really matters.\n\n📌 If this resonated
