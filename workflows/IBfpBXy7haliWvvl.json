Each video will be around 8 minutes, using clear and concise scripts with simple visuals, breaking down complex or controversial topics in an easy-to-understand way.\n\nCreate 20 click-worthy video titles in English that are:\n\n• ≤10 words each\n• Focused on ideologies, political systems, societal concepts, or mysterious history\n• Neutral or third-person voice (“inside,” “history,” “origins,” “the story of…”)\n• Packed with curiosity, shock, or educational hooks (“bizarre,” “forgotten,” “strangest,” “truth about,” “explained,” “origins of,” “the real story,” etc.)\n\n• Inspired by the

TTM Image Prompt\nA stick figure [short, tousled black hair, dot eyes, gentle friendly smile—appearance always the same in every scene, fully clothed, visually neutral, and relatable. Posture and action should reflect the specific emotion or action described in the narration, always wholesome, never exaggerated, non-cartoonish or provocative].\nSet in [a symbolic, historical, or conceptual environment directly representing the narration segment, designed with accurate mood, visual clarity, and editorial intent].\nStyle: doodle cartoon, with textured brush outlines and explainer-video inspiration.\nShading & Gradients: soft, naturalistic shading and gentle gradients for depth and visual interest.\nLayers:\n\nForeground: [clearly describe all main elements, e.g. characters, symbolic objects, or narrative focus]\n\nMidground: [supporting scene elements, additional props or background characters, if relevant]\n\nBackground: [setting, architecture, landscape, or abstract shapes—always slightly muted to avoid visual competition with foreground]\n\nStick-figure posture: [clearly describe, emotionally or conceptually expressive, appropriate for the narration, always safe and non-suggestive].\nFacial expression: [dot eyes and gentle, approachable smile, adjusted for the narration’s emotion].\nAccessory: [only metaphorical, symbolic, or historical objects related to the narration—never realistic weapons, provocative props, or platform-unsafe items].\nMotion cue: [describe gentle or expressive movements, if any—never imply violence, harm, or suggestiveness].\nEnvironment: [historical, emotional, or metaphorical scene as implied by the narration—literal or symbolically abstract as needed].\nSymbolic object: [the clearest visual metaphor or concept from the narration, prominently included].\nColor palette: [Gen Z-inspired—muted neons, cozy pastels, or moody contrasts. Use soft harmonies to ensure readability and editorial overlay compatibility.]\n\nText Label Zones (for editable overlays):\nInclude 1–3 distinct, visually obvious, and non-overlapping “text label zones” (such as a sticky note, chalkboard, empty speech bubble, or a labeled box or sign).\nThese should appear as blanks or with obvious squiggly lines, dashes, or blurred scribbles—never any readable letters, numbers, or symbols.\nEach zone should be large enough and well-placed for easy digital text overlay during video editing (avoid crowding or obscuring key artwork).\n\nCharacter Consistency Anchor:\nThe stick figure must always have short, tousled black hair, dot eyes, a gentle, friendly smile, and a simple, neutral face. This character anchor must not change across any prompt, scene, or emotion.\n\nContent Safety Requirements:\nAll visuals must be cartoonish, wholesome, educational, and 100% safe for work and platform upload.\nNo nudity, violence, suggestive poses, adult content, or explicit themes—figures always fully clothed and non-provocative.\nAny metaphorical objects (chains, masks, mirrors, etc.) must be depicted in a clearly educational, historical, or motivational context, and never in a way that could be misinterpreted as harmful or unsafe.\nAvoid any imagery or composition that could trigger NSFW, copyright, or safety filters.\n\nInstructions:\nDo not paraphrase, reinterpret, or summarize the narration segment.\nYour job is to translate its literal meaning and feeling directly into a symbolic visual scene, matching the tone, message, and context of the narration.\nUse clear, direct metaphors, analogies, and relevant historical references.\nDo not generate or suggest any real readable text in the image; “label zones” must be visually obvious but always blank or squiggled.\n\nOutput only the TTM Image Prompt for the provided narration segment.\n\n2. Speech Bubble Text Suggestion\nAfter generating the image prompt, also provide a concise, high-impact phrase or keyword that best summarizes or highlights the core idea of the narration segment.\nThis text is intended to be added digitally inside the main speech bubble or primary label zone of the image during editing.\nKeep the phrase short, punchy, and visually clear (ideally 2–6 words), always relevant to the narration segment, and never generic or off-topic.\n\nOutput Format Example:\n\nTTM Image Prompt:\n[...full image prompt as above...]\n\nSpeech Bubble Text Suggestion:\n\"[insert short text here]\"",

          "output": "| No | Script Segment |\n|----|---------------|\n| 1  | Imagine a world where strikes weren't just about better wages, but about seizing control of the factories themselves. |\n| 2  | That was the core belief of Syndicalism. |\n| 3  | It was a radical, largely forgotten ideology. |\n| 4  | It briefly flickered with revolutionary potential across the globe. |\n| 5  | It wasn't communism. |\n| 6  | It wasn't anarchism. |\n| 7  | Though it borrowed from both. |\n| 8  | But it was something uniquely its own. |\n| 9  | A vision of worker self-management so audacious it briefly seemed possible. |\n| 10 | Picture a giant, intricate clock. |\n| 11 | Its gears representing the various power structures of society. |\n| 12 | Syndicalism aimed to dismantle those gears. |\n| 13 | It didn't just want to tweak them. |\n| 14 | It believed workers, organized into powerful unions, could become the central mechanism itself. |\n| 15 | Directing the flow of labor and production. |\n| 16 | Originating in late 19th-century Europe, particularly in France and Spain. |\n| 17 | Syndicalism arose as a reaction against the perceived failures of both liberal democracy and traditional socialist parties. |\n| 18 | Many workers felt they were too slow and too compromised to deliver real change. |\n| 19 | It wasn't about voting for politicians. |\n| 20 | It was about the power of collective action. |\n| 21 | It was about building a parallel structure of worker-controlled unions, or \"syndicates.\" |\n| 22 | That could eventually supplant the state. |\n| 23 | Think of it like a shadow government. |\n| 24 | But one built on the foundation of labor. |\n| 25 | Preparing to take over. |\n| 26 | The term \"syndicalism\" itself, derived from the French word \"syndicat\" meaning trade union, initially simply referred to the ideology of these worker organizations. |\n| 27 | It quickly evolved to encompass a broader revolutionary program. |\n| 28 | It emphasized direct action-strikes, boycotts, sabotage-as the primary tools for achieving social transformation. |\n| 29 | These weren't your average work stoppages. |\n| 30 | Syndicalists envisioned \"general strikes,\" massive, coordinated shutdowns of entire industries. |\n| 31 | Potentially encompassing the entire nation. |\n| 32 | To demonstrate worker power and pave the way for a worker-led revolution. |\n| 33 | Picture a seesaw. |\n| 34 | With power on one side and liberty on the other. |\n| 35 | Syndicalists believed that the current system had tipped severely towards power. |\n| 36 | A general strike would be the leverage to rebalance it. |\n| 37 | The ideology took hold particularly amongst industrial workers-miners in France, railway workers in Britain, dockworkers in the United States. |\n| 38 | Those most intimately familiar with the machinery of production and therefore, theoretically, best positioned to control it. |\n| 39 | Ironically, this focus on industrial power often overlooked the vital role of agricultural laborers and service workers. |\n| 40 | A significant blind spot that would later contribute to its decline. |\n| 41 | A surprising early figure in the development of Syndicalist thought was Ferdinand Pelloutier. |\n| 42 | A French postal worker who, in the 1880s, advocated for unions to become \"economic producers.\" |\n| 43 | Effectively replacing capitalist ownership. |\n| 44 | While his ideas were initially dismissed as utopian. |\n| 45 | They laid the groundwork for the more radical, action-oriented Syndicalism that would follow. |\n| 46 | The burgeoning anarchist movement provided a fertile intellectual ground for Syndicalist ideas. |\n| 47 | Many Syndicalists saw anarchism as the ultimate goal-a stateless society based on voluntary cooperation. |\n| 48 | Viewing Syndicalist organization as the practical means to achieve it. |\n| 49 | Think of anarchism as the dream of ultimate freedom. |\n| 50 | And Syndicalism as the building plan to get there. |\n| 51 | However, unlike many anarchists who rejected any form of organization. |\n| 52 | Syndicalists believed that strong, disciplined unions were crucial for effective action. |\n| 53 | The International Workingmen's Association, founded by Karl Marx, initially saw some influence. |\n| 54 | As Marxist parties shifted towards electoral politics. |\n| 55 | Syndicalism emerged as an alternative path for revolutionary change. |\n| 56 | What many don't realize is that the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, a massive labor uprising in Canada, was deeply influenced by Syndicalist ideas. |\n| 57 | Although the strikers themselves didn't explicitly identify as Syndicalists. |\n| 58 | It was brutally suppressed by the government. |\n| 59 | Demonstrating the fragility of worker power in the face of state repression. |\n| 60 | Contributing to the decline of organized labor in Canada for decades. |\n| 61 | The Spanish CNT (Confederacin Nacional del Trabajo), founded in 1910, became arguably the most powerful and influential Syndicalist organization globally. |\n| 62 | It was wildly successful in organizing workers, particularly in Catalonia. |\n| 63 | And negotiated significant improvements in wages and working conditions. |\n| 64 | Picture a honeycomb. |\n| 65 | Each cell representing a worker being organized and empowered. |\n| 66 | The CNT aimed to build a network of worker solidarity, strong enough to withstand any external pressure. |\n| 67 | However, the CNT's confrontational tactics and revolutionary rhetoric also made it a target for government crackdowns and violence. |\n| 68 | The \"Tragic Week\" of Barcelona in 1909, a violent confrontation between workers and the army triggered by a small strike, vividly illustrated the dangers faced by Syndicalist activists. |\n| 69 | It wasn't a planned uprising. |\n| 70 | But the sheer intensity of the violence-hundreds killed, hundreds more injured-demonstrated the underlying tensions simmering beneath the surface of Spanish society. |\n| 71 | The outbreak of World War I proved to be a fatal blow for many Syndicalist movements. |\n| 72 | While initially opposed to the war. |\n| 73 | Many Syndicalists were divided over how to respond. |\n| 74 | Some advocated for sabotage to prevent the war effort. |\n| 75 | While others felt that neutrality was the best course of action. |\n| 76 | The war effectively destroyed the possibility of international solidarity. |\n| 77 | A cornerstone of Syndicalist ideology. |\n| 78 | Surprisingly, the Russian Revolution, initially seen by some Syndicalists as a potential ally. |\n| 79 | Ultimately proved to be a major disappointment. |\n| 80 | The Bolsheviks' centralized, authoritarian approach to revolution was fundamentally at odds with the decentralized, worker-led model advocated by Syndicalists. |\n| 81 | The suppression of worker autonomy in the Soviet Union demonstrated the dangers of revolutionary movements being hijacked by political elites. |\n| 82 | Imagine a river. |\n| 83 | Initially flowing freely. |\n| 84 | But then being channeled into a rigid canal by a powerful force. |\n| 85 | This is what many Syndicalists felt happened to the revolutionary potential of Russia. |\n| 86 | The rise of fascism in the 1920s and 1930s further marginalized Syndicalist movements. |\n| 87 | The brutal suppression of labor unions in Italy and Spain made it increasingly difficult for Syndicalists to operate openly. |\n| 88 | The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) represented both an opportunity and a tragedy for the CNT. |\n| 89 | The overthrow of the right-wing government created a brief window for worker self-management in Catalonia. |\n| 90 | With workers seizing control of factories and farms. |\n| 91 | However, infighting within the CNT and the overwhelming military power of Franco's fascist forces ultimately led to a devastating defeat. |\n| 92 | The \"Banc Expropiat\" incident in Barcelona, where the CNT seized control of a bank and distributed the funds to workers, showcases both the audacity and the naivety of some Syndicalist actions. |\n| 93 | The bank was quickly retaken. |\n| 94 | And the incident contributed to a perception of the CNT as reckless and irresponsible. |\n| 95 | Even during the Spanish Civil War, internal disagreements arose. |\n| 96 | The more revolutionary faction, wanting complete worker control. |\n| 97 | Clashed with a more pragmatic faction that favored cooperation with other leftist groups. |\n| 98 | Following World War II, Syndicalism largely faded from the mainstream. |\n| 99 | Though its ideas continued to influence certain strands of the New Left and contemporary movements for worker empowerment. |\n| 100 | The 'Operation Solidarity' campaign in the late 1970s, aimed at supporting striking British miners, demonstrated a revival of interest in direct action and worker solidarity. |\n| 101 | What many don't realize is that the Winnipeg General

It wasn’t about voting for politicians; it was about the power of collective action, about building a parallel structure of worker-controlled unions, or \"syndicates,\" that could eventually supplant the state. Think of it like a shadow government, but one built on the foundation of labor, preparing to take over. The term \"syndicalism\" itself, derived from the French word \"syndicat\" meaning trade union, initially simply referred to the ideology of these worker organizations, but quickly evolved to encompass a broader revolutionary program. It emphasized direct action—strikes, boycotts, sabotage—as the primary tools for achieving social transformation. These weren't your average work stoppages; Syndicalists envisioned “general strikes,” massive, coordinated shutdowns of entire industries, potentially encompassing the entire nation, to demonstrate worker power and pave the way for a worker-led revolution. Picture a seesaw, with power on one side and liberty on the other; Syndicalists believed that the current system had tipped severely towards power, and a general strike would be the leverage to rebalance it.  The ideology took hold particularly amongst industrial workers—miners in France, railway workers in Britain, dockworkers in the United States—those most intimately familiar with the machinery of production and therefore, theoretically, best positioned to control it.  Ironically, this focus on industrial power often overlooked the vital role of agricultural laborers and service workers, a significant blind spot that would later contribute to its decline.  A surprising early figure in the development of Syndicalist thought was Ferdinand Pelloutier, a French postal worker who, in the 1880s, advocated for unions to become “economic producers,” effectively replacing capitalist ownership. While his ideas were initially dismissed as utopian, they laid the groundwork for the more radical, action-oriented Syndicalism that would follow. The burgeoning anarchist movement provided a fertile intellectual ground for Syndicalist ideas; many Syndicalists saw anarchism as the ultimate goal—a stateless society based on voluntary cooperation—while viewing Syndicalist organization as the practical means to achieve it. Think of anarchism as the dream of ultimate freedom, and Syndicalism as the building plan to get there. However, unlike many anarchists who rejected any form of organization, Syndicalists believed that strong, disciplined unions were crucial for effective action.  The International Workingmen's Association, founded by Karl Marx, initially saw some influence, but as Marxist parties shifted towards electoral politics, Syndicalism emerged as an alternative path for revolutionary change.  What many don’t realize is that the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919, a massive labor uprising in Canada, was deeply influenced by Syndicalist ideas, although the strikers themselves didn't explicitly identify as Syndicalists. It was brutally suppressed by the government, demonstrating the fragility of worker power in the face of state repression, and contributing to the decline of organized labor in Canada for decades.  The Spanish CNT (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo), founded in 1910, became arguably the most powerful and influential Syndicalist organization globally.  It was wildly successful in organizing workers, particularly in Catalonia, and negotiated significant improvements in wages and working conditions. Picture a honeycomb, each cell representing a worker being organized and empowered; the CNT aimed to build a network of worker solidarity, strong enough to withstand any external pressure.  However, the CNT’s confrontational tactics and revolutionary rhetoric also made it a target for government crackdowns and violence.  The “Tragic Week” of Barcelona in 1909, a violent confrontation between workers and the army triggered by a small strike, vividly illustrated the dangers faced by Syndicalist activists. It wasn’t a planned uprising, but the sheer intensity of the violence—hundreds killed, hundreds more injured—demonstrated the underlying tensions simmering beneath the surface of Spanish society.   The outbreak of World War I proved to be a fatal blow for many Syndicalist movements.  While initially opposed to the war, many Syndicalists were divided over how to respond.  Some advocated for sabotage to prevent the war effort, while others felt that neutrality was the best course of action.   The war effectively destroyed the possibility of international solidarity, a cornerstone of Syndicalist ideology.   Surprisingly, the Russian Revolution, initially seen by some Syndicalists as a potential ally, ultimately proved to be a major disappointment.  The Bolsheviks' centralized, authoritarian approach to revolution was fundamentally at odds with the decentralized, worker-led model advocated by Syndicalists.  The suppression of worker autonomy in the Soviet Union demonstrated the dangers of revolutionary movements being hijacked by political elites.  Imagine a river, initially flowing freely, but then being channeled into a rigid canal by a powerful force; this is what many Syndicalists felt happened to the revolutionary potential of Russia.  The rise of fascism in the 1920s and 1930s further marginalized Syndicalist movements.  The brutal suppression of labor unions in Italy and Spain made it increasingly difficult for Syndicalists to operate openly.  The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) represented both an opportunity and a tragedy for the CNT.  The overthrow of the right-wing government created a brief window for worker self-management in Catalonia, with workers seizing control of factories and farms.  However, infighting within the CNT and the overwhelming military power of Franco’s fascist forces ultimately led to a devastating defeat. The “Banc Expropiat” incident in Barcelona, where the CNT seized control of a bank and distributed the funds to workers, showcases both the audacity and the naivety of some Syndicalist actions. The bank was quickly retaken, and the incident contributed to a perception of the CNT as reckless and irresponsible. Even during the Spanish Civil War, internal disagreements arose; the more revolutionary faction, wanting complete worker control, clashed with a more pragmatic faction that favored cooperation with other leftist groups.  Following World War II, Syndicalism largely faded from the mainstream, though its ideas continued to influence certain strands of the New Left and contemporary movements for worker empowerment.  The ‘Operation Solidarity’ campaign in the late 1970s, aimed at supporting striking British miners, demonstrated a revival of interest in direct action and worker solidarity inspired by Syndicalist principles.  What many don’t realize is that elements of the “gig economy” – platforms like Uber and Lyft – can be seen as a distorted reflection of Syndicalist ideals; workers technically own their “means of production” (their cars), but are ultimately controlled by a centralized platform. It’s a shadow of the original vision.  The strangest part is that, while Syndicalism never achieved its ultimate goal of a worker-led society, its emphasis on direct action, worker solidarity, and self-management continues to resonate with activists around the world, demonstrating the enduring power of its radical vision, even if its specific form has largely disappeared from the historical record. The clock gears may have been scattered, but the desire to reimagine power continues to tick.\n\n\n\n"
